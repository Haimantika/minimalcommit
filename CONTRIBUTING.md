Thank you for considering contributing to Minimal Commit! Your contributions are valuable in helping us improve and grow. To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please follow these guidelines when working on issues:

## Check for Existing Issues
Before you start working on any feature, enhancement, or bug fix, it's important to check if there's an existing issue for it. This helps prevent duplicate work and ensures that the issue is still relevant.

## Create an Issue
If you cannot find an existing issue related to the task you want to work on, please create a new issue. A well-documented issue should include the following information:

- A clear and concise title that describes the problem or feature.
- A detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug.
- The version of the software the issue is related to.
- Any relevant screenshots or code examples.
- Any additional context that might be helpful in understanding the issue.

## Request Ownership of the Issue
If you find an existing issue that you'd like to work on and it has not been assigned to anyone, you can request ownership of the issue. 

Here's how to do it:

- Comment on the issue expressing your interest.
- Mention how you would like to approach the issue
- Wait for a response from the maintainers of the project. 

## Next Steps
Once the issue is assigned to you, it's time to start working on it. Make sure to adhere to our coding and documentation standards.Keep your assigned issue updated with your progress and any challenges you encounter. If you're unable to continue working on the issue for any reason, please let us know as soon as possible.

## Request to Work on Stalled Issues
If an issue has been assigned to someone else and there have been no updates or activity for more than two weeks, you may request to work on it. This helps keep the project moving and ensures that issues are not left unattended for extended periods.

To request to work on a stalled issue:

- Comment on the issue, expressing your interest and the reason you believe it's stalled.
- Wait for a response from the maintainers. They will assess the situation and may reassign the issue to you if the original assignee is unresponsive.

Thank you for your contributions and for helping us make this project better. Your dedication and collaboration are greatly appreciated!
